"Improved_LDL_transport_AVS.py" preserves all the same code as "LDL_transport_LAD_Ogalic.py" but with a new section on Vesicular Permeability (P-v).
This should be able to be coupled to their 2D FSI model in ANSYS as a biotransport equation.
The "LDL_and_LAD_Heat_Map_Code.py" script should be able to be run independently to generate heat maps.
