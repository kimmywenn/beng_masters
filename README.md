"Improved_LDL_transport_AVS.py" preserves all the same code as "LDL_transport_LAD_Ogalic.py" but with a new section on Vesicular Permeability (P-v)
This should be able to be coupled to their 2D FSI model in ansys as a biotransport eqaution
After running that, the environment will contain all geometric and property parameters necessary to generate our heat maps with the "LDL_and_LAD_Heat_Map_Code.py" script
